R-loop dependent promoter-proximal termination ensures genome stability,"The proper regulation of transcription is essential for maintaining genome integrity and executing other downstream cellular functions1,2. Here, we identify SOSS-INTAC as a stable association of the genome stability regulator Sensor of Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (SOSS)3 and the transcription regulator Integrator-PP2A (INTAC)4-6. Via SSB1-mediated ssDNA recognition, SOSS-INTAC stimulates promoter-proximal termination of transcription and attenuates paused Pol II-associated R-loops to prevent R-loop-induced genome instability. SOSS-INTAC-dependent attenuation of R-loops is enhanced by SSB1's ability to form liquid-like condensates. Deletion of, or introduction of cancer-associated mutations within its intrinsically disordered region (IDR), leads to pervasive accumulation of R-loops, highlighting a genome surveillance function of SOSS-INTAC that enables timely termination of transcription at promoters to constrain R-loop accumulation to ensure genome stability.",Congling Xu Chengyu Li Jiwei Chen Yan Xiong Zhibin Qiao Pengyu Fan Conghui Li Shuangyu Ma Jin Liu Aixia Song Bolin Tao Tao Xu Wei Xu Yayun Chi Jingyan Xue Pu Wang Dan Ye Hongzhou Gu Peng Zhang Qiong Wang Ruijing Xiao Jingdong Cheng Hai Zheng Xiaoli Yu Zhen Zhang Jiong Wu Kaiwei Liang Yan-Jun Liu Huasong Lu Fei Xavier Chen,10.1038s41586-023-06515-5,2023-08-09
Dopamine and glutamate regulate striatal acetylcholine in decision-making,"Striatal dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (Ach) are essential for the selection and reinforcement of motor actions and decision-making1. In vitro studies have revealed an intrastriatal circuit in which Ach, released by cholinergic interneurons (CINs), drives DA release, and DA in turn inhibits CIN activity via dopamine D2 receptors (D2R). Whether and how this circuit contributes to striatal function in vivo is largely unknown. To define the role of this circuit in vivo, we monitored Ach and DA signals in the ventrolateral striatum of mice performing a reward-based decision-making task. We establish that DA and Ach exhibit multiphasic and anticorrelated transients that are modulated by decision history and reward outcome. DA dynamics and reward encoding do not require Ach release by CINs. However, DA inhibits Ach transients in a D2R-dependent manner and loss of this regulation impairs decision-making. To determine how other striatal inputs shape Ach signals, we assessed the contribution of cortical and thalamic projections and found that glutamate release from both sources is required for Ach release. Altogether, we uncover a dynamic relationship between DA and Ach during decision-making and reveal multiple modes of CIN regulation. These findings deepen our understanding of the neurochemical basis of decision-making and behavior.",Lynne Chantranupong Celia C. Beron Joshua A. Zimmer Michelle J. Wen Wengang Wang Bernardo L.

Tautomeric Mixture Coordination Enables Efficient Lead-Free Perovskite LEDs,"Lead (Pb) halide perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have demonstrated extraordinary optoelectronic performance1-3. However, potential toxicity issues with Pb4,5 mean that removing Pb from the best-performing PeLEDs—without compromising their excellent external quantum efficiencies (EQEs)—remains a challenge. Here we report a tautomeric mixture coordination-induced electron localization strategy to stabilize Pb-free TEA2SnI4 (TEAI, 2-thiophenethylammonium iodide) perovskite by incorporating cyanuric acid (CA). We demonstrate that a crucial function of the coordination is to amplify electronic effects and even extend to Sn atoms without strong bonding with CA, due to the formation of H-bonded tautomeric dimer and trimer superstructures on the perovskite surface. This electron localization weakens adverse effects from Anderson localization and improves the ordering in crystal structure of TEA2SnI4. These factors give a two orders of magnitude reduction in nonradiative recombination capture coefficient and approximately 2-fold enhancement in exciton binding energy. Our Pb-free PeLED has an EQE of up to 20.29 per cent, representing a performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art Pb-containing PeLEDs6-12. We anticipate that these findings will provide insights into the stabilization of Sn(II) perovskites and further progress Pb-free perovskite applications.",Dongyuan Han Jie Wang Lorenzo Agosta Ziang Zang Bin Zhao Lingmei Kong Haizhou Lu Irea Mosquera-Lois Virginia Carnevali Jianchao Dong Jianheng Zhou Huiyu Ji Lukas Pfeifer Shaik M.

Neuronal migration prevents spatial competition in retinal morphogenesis,"The concomitant occurrence of tissue growth and organization is a hallmark of organismal development1–3. This often means that proliferating and differentiating cells are found at the same time in a continuously changing tissue environment. How cells adapt to architectural changes to prevent spatial interference remains unclear. Here, to understand how cell movements that are key for growth and organization are orchestrated, we study the emergence of photoreceptor neurons that occur during the peak of retinal growth, using zebrafish, human tissue and human organoids. Quantitative imaging reveals that successful retinal morphogenesis depends on the active bidirectional translocation of photoreceptors, leading to a transient transfer of the entire cell population away from the apical proliferative zone. This pattern of migration is driven by cytoskeletal machineries that differ depending on the direction: microtubules are exclusively required for basal translocation, whereas actomyosin is involved in apical movement. Blocking the basal translocation of photoreceptors induces apical congestion, which hampers the apical divisions of progenitor cells and leads to secondary defects in lamination. Thus, photoreceptor migration is crucial to prevent competition for space, and to allow concurrent tissue growth and lamination. This shows that neuronal migration, in addition to its canonical role in cell positioning4, can be involved in coordinating morphogenesis. Experiments in zebrafish and human tissues show that, during retinal morphogenesis, emerging photoreceptor cells migrate in a bidirectional manner, which lessens competition for space and helps to ensure that the retina is formed correctly.",Mauricio Rocha-Martins Elisa Nerli Jenny Kretzschmar Martin Weigert Jaroslav Icha Eugene W.

No evidence for magnetic field effects on the behaviour of Drosophila,"Migratory songbirds have the remarkable ability to extract directional information from the Earth’s magnetic field1,2. The exact mechanism of this light-dependent magnetic compass sense, however, is not fully understood. The most promising hypothesis focuses on the quantum spin dynamics of transient radical pairs formed in cryptochrome proteins in the retina3–5. Frustratingly, much of the supporting evidence for this theory is circumstantial, largely because of the extreme challenges posed by genetic modification of wild birds. Drosophila has therefore been recruited as a model organism, and several influential reports of cryptochrome-mediated magnetic field effects on fly behaviour have been widely interpreted as support for a radical pair-based mechanism in birds6–23. Here we report the results of an extensive study testing magnetic field effects on 97,658 flies moving in a two-arm maze and on 10,960 flies performing the spontaneous escape behaviour known as negative geotaxis. Under meticulously controlled conditions and with vast sample sizes, we have been unable to find evidence for magnetically sensitive behaviour in Drosophila. Moreover, after reassessment of the statistical approaches and sample sizes used in the studies that we tried to replicate, we suggest that many—if not all—of the original results were false positives. Our findings therefore cast considerable doubt on the existence of magnetic sensing in Drosophila and thus strongly suggest that night-migratory songbirds remain the organism of choice for elucidating the mechanism of light-dependent magnetoreception. Following testing of magnetic field effects on 97,658 flies moving in a two-arm maze and on 10,960 flies performing spontaneous escape behaviour (negative geotaxis), no evidence was found for magnetically sensitive behaviour in Drosophila.",Marco Bassetto Thomas Reichl Dmitry Kobylkov Daniel R.

Sustained wet–dry cycling on early Mars,"The presence of perennially wet surface environments on early Mars is well documented1,2, but little is known about short-term episodicity in the early hydroclimate3. Post-depositional processes driven by such short-term fluctuations may produce distinct structures, yet these are rarely preserved in the sedimentary record4. Incomplete geological constraints have led global models of the early Mars water cycle and climate to produce diverging results5,6. Here we report observations by the Curiosity rover at Gale Crater indicating that high-frequency wet–dry cycling occurred in early Martian surface environments. We observe exhumed centimetric polygonal ridges with sulfate enrichments, joined at Y-junctions, that record cracks formed in fresh mud owing to repeated wet–dry cycles of regular intensity. Instead of sporadic hydrological activity induced by impacts or volcanoes5, our findings point to a sustained, cyclic, possibly seasonal, climate on early Mars. Furthermore, as wet–dry cycling can promote prebiotic polymerization7,8, the Gale evaporitic basin may have been particularly conducive to these processes. The observed polygonal patterns are physically and temporally associated with the transition from smectite clays to sulfate-bearing strata, a globally distributed mineral transition1. This indicates that the Noachian–Hesperian transition (3.8–3.6 billion years ago) may have sustained an Earth-like climate regime and surface environments favourable to prebiotic evolution. Observations by the Curiosity rover at Gale Crater on Mars indicate that high-frequency wet–dry cycling occurred on the early Martian surface, indicating a possible seasonal climate conducive to prebiotic evolution on early Mars.",W.

Reversed Holocene temperature–moisture relationship in the Horn of Africa,"Anthropogenic climate change is predicted to severely impact the global hydrological cycle1, particularly in tropical regions where agriculture-based economies depend on monsoon rainfall2. In the Horn of Africa, more frequent drought conditions in recent decades3,4 contrast with climate models projecting precipitation to increase with rising temperature5. Here we use organic geochemical climate-proxy data from the sediment record of Lake Chala (Kenya and Tanzania) to probe the stability of the link between hydroclimate and temperature over approximately the past 75,000 years, hence encompassing a sufficiently wide range of temperatures to test the ‘dry gets drier, wet gets wetter’ paradigm6 of anthropogenic climate change in the time domain. We show that the positive relationship between effective moisture and temperature in easternmost Africa during the cooler last glacial period shifted to negative around the onset of the Holocene 11,700 years ago, when the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration exceeded 250 parts per million and mean annual temperature approached modern-day values. Thus, at that time, the budget between monsoonal precipitation and continental evaporation7 crossed a tipping point such that the positive influence of temperature on evaporation became greater than its positive influence on precipitation. Our results imply that under continued anthropogenic warming, the Horn of Africa will probably experience further drying, and they highlight the need for improved simulation of both dynamic and thermodynamic processes in the tropical hydrological cycle. Climate-proxy data indicate that during the last glacial period in the Horn of Africa higher temperatures were associated with greater moisture availability, whereas during the current interglacial period, as well as historically, higher temperatures have been associated with increased drought.",A.

Lactate limits CNS autoimmunity by stabilizing HIF-1α in dendritic cells,"Dendritic cells (DCs) have a role in the development and activation of self-reactive pathogenic T cells1,2. Genetic variants that are associated with the function of DCs have been linked to autoimmune disorders3,4, and DCs are therefore attractive therapeutic targets for such diseases. However, developing DC-targeted therapies for autoimmunity requires identification of the mechanisms that regulate DC function. Here, using single-cell and bulk transcriptional and metabolic analyses in combination with cell-specific gene perturbation studies, we identify a regulatory loop of negative feedback that operates in DCs to limit immunopathology. Specifically, we find that lactate, produced by activated DCs and other immune cells, boosts the expression of NDUFA4L2 through a mechanism mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). NDUFA4L2 limits the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species that activate XBP1-driven transcriptional modules in DCs that are involved in the control of pathogenic autoimmune T cells. We also engineer a probiotic that produces lactate and suppresses T cell autoimmunity through the activation of HIF-1α–NDUFA4L2 signalling in DCs. In summary, we identify an immunometabolic pathway that regulates DC function, and develop a synthetic probiotic for its therapeutic activation. Lactate produced by dendritic cells (DCs) suppresses T-cell-mediated autoimmunity through a mechanism in which lactate activates HIF-1α–NDUFA4L2 signalling in DCs and thereby limits DC-mediated pro-inflammatory responses such as the development of encephalitogenic T cells.",Liliana M.

Carbonate-rich crust subduction drives the deep carbon and chlorine cycles,"The flux balances of carbon and chlorine between subduction into the deep mantle and volcanic emissions into the atmosphere are crucial for the habitability of our planet1,2. However, pervasive loss of fluids from subducting slabs has been thought to cut off the delivery of both carbon and chlorine to the deep mantle owing to their high mobility under hydrous conditions3,4. Our new high-pressure experiments show that most carbonates (>75 wt%) in carbonate-rich crustal rocks—one of the main subducting carbon reservoirs—survive devolatilization and hydrous melting in cold and warm subduction zones, indicating that their subduction has driven the deep carbon cycle since the Mesoproterozoic. We found that KCl and NaCl, respectively, become stable phases crystallizing from hydrous carbonatite melts with low chlorine solubility in warm and hot subduction zones, resulting in the sequestration of chlorine in the solid residue in downwelling slabs. Accordingly, the subduction of carbonate-rich rocks facilitated highly effective recycling of both chlorine and carbon into the deep mantle at intermediate stages of Earth’s history and led to declining atmospheric pCO2 and the formation of carbon-rich and chlorine-rich mantle reservoirs since the Mesoproterozoic. This period of optimal carbon and chlorine subduction may explain the ages of eclogitic diamonds and the formation of the HIMU mantle source. New experiments show that most carbonates in carbonate-rich crustal rocks survive devolatilization and hydrous melting in cold and warm subduction zones, demonstrating their role in driving the deep carbon and chlorine cycles since the Mesoproterozoic.",Chunfei Chen Michael W.

Mitochondrial integrated stress response controls lung epithelial cell fate,"Alveolar epithelial type 1 (AT1) cells are necessary to transfer oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and air. Alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells serve as a partially committed stem cell population, producing AT1 cells during postnatal alveolar development and repair after influenza A and SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia1–6. Little is known about the metabolic regulation of the fate of lung epithelial cells. Here we report that deleting the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I subunit Ndufs2 in lung epithelial cells during mouse gestation led to death during postnatal alveolar development. Affected mice displayed hypertrophic cells with AT2 and AT1 cell features, known as transitional cells. Mammalian mitochondrial complex I, comprising 45 subunits, regenerates NAD+ and pumps protons. Conditional expression of yeast NADH dehydrogenase (NDI1) protein that regenerates NAD+ without proton pumping7,8 was sufficient to correct abnormal alveolar development and avert lethality. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed enrichment of integrated stress response (ISR) genes in transitional cells. Administering an ISR inhibitor9,10 or NAD+ precursor reduced ISR gene signatures in epithelial cells and partially rescued lethality in the absence of mitochondrial complex I function. Notably, lung epithelial-specific loss of mitochondrial electron transport chain complex II subunit Sdhd, which maintains NAD+ regeneration, did not trigger high ISR activation or lethality. These findings highlight an unanticipated requirement for mitochondrial complex I-dependent NAD+ regeneration in directing cell fate during postnatal alveolar development by preventing pathological ISR induction. This study highlights the role of mitochondrial complex I-dependent NAD+ regeneration in directing lung epithelial cell fate during postnatal alveolar development by preventing pathological integrated stress response induction.",SeungHye Han Minho Lee Youngjin Shin Regina Giovanni Ram P.

The recovery of European freshwater biodiversity has come to a halt,"Owing to a long history of anthropogenic pressures, freshwater ecosystems are among the most vulnerable to biodiversity loss1. Mitigation measures, including wastewater treatment and hydromorphological restoration, have aimed to improve environmental quality and foster the recovery of freshwater biodiversity2. Here, using 1,816 time series of freshwater invertebrate communities collected across 22 European countries between 1968 and 2020, we quantified temporal trends in taxonomic and functional diversity and their responses to environmental pressures and gradients. We observed overall increases in taxon richness (0.73% per year), functional richness (2.4% per year) and abundance (1.17% per year). However, these increases primarily occurred before the 2010s, and have since plateaued. Freshwater communities downstream of dams, urban areas and cropland were less likely to experience recovery. Communities at sites with faster rates of warming had fewer gains in taxon richness, functional richness and abundance. Although biodiversity gains in the 1990s and 2000s probably reflect the effectiveness of water-quality improvements and restoration projects, the decelerating trajectory in the 2010s suggests that the current measures offer diminishing returns. Given new and persistent pressures on freshwater ecosystems, including emerging pollutants, climate change and the spread of invasive species, we call for additional mitigation to revive the recovery of freshwater biodiversity. Improvements in European freshwater biodiversity occurred mainly before 2010 but have since plateaued, and communities downstream of dams, urban areas and cropland were less likely to experience recovery.",Peter Haase Diana E.

Solid-body trajectoids shaped to roll along desired pathways,"In everyday life, rolling motion is typically associated with cylindrical (for example, car wheels) or spherical (for example, billiard balls) bodies tracing linear paths. However, mathematicians have, for decades, been interested in more exotically shaped solids such as the famous oloids1, sphericons2, polycons3, platonicons4 and two-circle rollers5 that roll downhill in curvilinear paths (in contrast to cylinders or spheres) yet indefinitely (in contrast to cones, Supplementary Video 1). The trajectories traced by such bodies have been studied in detail6–9, and can be useful in the context of efficient mixing10,11 and robotics, for example, in magnetically actuated, millimetre-sized sphericon-shaped robots12,13, or larger sphericon- and oloid-shaped robots translocating by shifting their centre of mass14,15. However, the rolling paths of these shapes are all sinusoid-like and their diversity ends there. Accordingly, we were intrigued whether a more general problem is solvable: given an infinite periodic trajectory, find the shape that would trace this trajectory when rolling down a slope. Here, we develop an algorithm to design such bodies—which we call ‘trajectoids’—and then validate these designs experimentally by three-dimensionally printing the computed shapes and tracking their rolling paths, including those that close onto themselves such that the body’s centre of mass moves intermittently uphill (Supplementary Video 2). Our study is motivated largely by fundamental curiosity, but the existence of trajectoids for most paths has unexpected implications for quantum and classical optics, as the dynamics of qubits, spins and light polarization can be exactly mapped to trajectoids and their paths16. An algorithm is developed to design a shape, a trajectoid, that can trace any given infinite periodic trajectory when rolling down a slope, finding unexpected implications for quantum and classical optics.",Yaroslav I.

Europeans’ support for refugees of varying background is stable over time,"Protracted global conflicts during the past decade have led to repeated major humanitarian protection crises in Europe. During the height of the Syrian refugee crisis at the end of 2015, Europe hosted around 2.3 million people requesting asylum1. Today, the ongoing war in Ukraine has resulted in one of the largest humanitarian emergencies in Europe since World War II, with more than eight million Ukrainians seeking refuge across Europe2. Here we explore whether repeated humanitarian crises threaten to exhaust solidarity and whether Europeans welcome Ukrainian asylum seekers over other asylum seekers3,4. We conducted repeat conjoint experiments during the 2015–2016 and 2022 refugee crises, asking 33,000 citizens in 15 European countries to evaluate randomly varied profiles of asylum seekers. We find that public preferences for asylum seekers with specific attributes have remained remarkably stable and general support has, if anything, increased slightly over time. Ukrainian asylum seekers were welcomed in 2022, with their demographic, religious and displacement profile having a larger role than their nationality. Yet, this welcome did not come at the expense of support for other marginalized refugee groups, such as Muslim refugees. These findings have implications for our theoretical understanding of the drivers and resilience of public attitudes towards refugees and for policymakers tasked to find effective responses to the enduring stress on the asylum system5–8. Surveys conducted in 15 European countries in 2016 and 2022 show stable attitudes towards asylum seekers and refugees with different attributes over this period with a slight increase in support for asylum seekers in general.",Kirk Bansak Jens Hainmueller Dominik Hangartner,10.1038s41586-023-06417-6,2023-08-09
Pines’ demon observed as a 3D acoustic plasmon in Sr2RuO4,"The characteristic excitation of a metal is its plasmon, which is a quantized collective oscillation of its electron density. In 1956, David Pines predicted that a distinct type of plasmon, dubbed a ‘demon’, could exist in three-dimensional (3D) metals containing more than one species of charge carrier1. Consisting of out-of-phase movement of electrons in different bands, demons are acoustic, electrically neutral and do not couple to light, so have never been detected in an equilibrium, 3D metal. Nevertheless, demons are believed to be critical for diverse phenomena including phase transitions in mixed-valence semimetals2, optical properties of metal nanoparticles3, soundarons in Weyl semimetals4 and high-temperature superconductivity in, for example, metal hydrides3,5–7. Here, we present evidence for a demon in Sr2RuO4 from momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Formed of electrons in the β and γ bands, the demon is gapless with critical momentum qc = 0.08 reciprocal lattice units and room-temperature velocity v = (1.065 ± 0.12) × 105 m s−1 that undergoes a 31% renormalization upon cooling to 30 K because of coupling to the particle–hole continuum. The momentum dependence of the intensity of the demon confirms its neutral character. Our study confirms a 67-year old prediction and indicates that demons may be a pervasive feature of multiband metals. Evidence is presented for a Pines’ demon as a three-dimensional acoustic plasmon in the multiband metal Sr2RuO4 from momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy using a collimated, defocused beam with high momentum resolution.",Ali A.

Coral reefs benefit from reduced land–sea impacts under ocean warming,"Coral reef ecosystems are being fundamentally restructured by local human impacts and climate-driven marine heatwaves that trigger mass coral bleaching and mortality1. Reducing local impacts can increase reef resistance to and recovery from bleaching2. However, resource managers lack clear advice on targeted actions that best support coral reefs under climate change3 and sector-based governance means most land- and sea-based management efforts remain siloed4. Here we combine surveys of reef change with a unique 20-year time series of land–sea human impacts that encompassed an unprecedented marine heatwave in Hawai‘i. Reefs with increased herbivorous fish populations and reduced land-based impacts, such as wastewater pollution and urban runoff, had positive coral cover trajectories predisturbance. These reefs also experienced a modest reduction in coral mortality following severe heat stress compared to reefs with reduced fish populations and enhanced land-based impacts. Scenario modelling indicated that simultaneously reducing land–sea human impacts results in a three- to sixfold greater probability of a reef having high reef-builder cover four years postdisturbance than if either occurred in isolation. International efforts to protect 30% of Earth’s land and ocean ecosystems by 2030 are underway5. Our results reveal that integrated land–sea management could help achieve coastal ocean conservation goals and provide coral reefs with the best opportunity to persist in our changing climate.

TRIM5α restricts poxviruses and is antagonized by CypA and the viral protein C6,"Human tripartite motif protein 5α (TRIM5α) is a well-characterized restriction factor for some RNA viruses, including HIV1–5; however, reports are limited for DNA viruses6,7. Here we demonstrate that TRIM5α also restricts orthopoxviruses and, via its SPRY domain, binds to the orthopoxvirus capsid protein L3 to diminish virus replication and activate innate immunity. In response, several orthopoxviruses, including vaccinia, rabbitpox, cowpox, monkeypox, camelpox and variola viruses, deploy countermeasures. First, the protein C6 binds to TRIM5 via the RING domain to induce its proteasome-dependent degradation. Second, cyclophilin A (CypA) is recruited via interaction with the capsid protein L3 to virus factories and virions to antagonize TRIM5α; this interaction is prevented by cyclosporine A (CsA) and the non-immunosuppressive derivatives alisporivir and NIM811. Both the proviral effect of CypA and the antiviral effect of CsA are dependent on TRIM5α. CsA, alisporivir and NIM811 have antiviral activity against orthopoxviruses, and because these drugs target a cellular protein, CypA, the emergence of viral drug resistance is difficult. These results warrant testing of CsA derivatives against orthopoxviruses, including monkeypox and variola. The well-characterized HIV restriction factor TRIM5α also restricts orthopoxviruses and is countered by the viral protein C6 and the proviral activity of CypA, which in turn is antagonized by CsA and derivatives alisporivir and NIM811.",Yiqi Zhao Yongxu Lu Samuel Richardson Meghna Sreekumar Jonas D.

Intrinsic dopamine and acetylcholine dynamics in the striatum of mice,"External rewards such as food and money are potent modifiers of behaviour1,2. Pioneering studies established that these salient sensory stimuli briefly interrupt the tonic discharge of neurons that produce the neuromodulators dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh): midbrain DA neurons (DANs) fire a burst of action potentials that broadly elevates DA in the striatum3,4 at the same time that striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) produce a characteristic pause in firing5,6. These phasic responses are thought to create unique, temporally limited conditions that motivate action and promote learning7–11. However, the dynamics of DA and ACh outside explicitly rewarded situations remain poorly understood. Here we show that extracellular DA and ACh levels fluctuate spontaneously and periodically at a frequency of approximately 2 Hz in the dorsal striatum of mice and maintain the same temporal relationship relative to one another as that evoked by reward. We show that this neuromodulatory coordination does not arise from direct interactions between DA and ACh within the striatum. Instead, we provide evidence that periodic fluctuations in striatal DA are inherited from midbrain DANs, while striatal ACh transients are driven by glutamatergic inputs, which act to locally synchronize the spiking of CINs. Together, our findings show that striatal neuromodulatory dynamics are autonomously organized by distributed extra-striatal afferents. The dominance of intrinsic rhythms in DA and ACh offers new insights for explaining how reward-associated neural dynamics emerge and how the brain motivates action and promotes learning from within. In the absence of reward, dopamine and acetylcholine levels in the striatum fluctuate in a phasic manner, with their dynamics autonomously organized by extra-striatal neurons.",Anne C.

Dissecting human population variation in single-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2,"Humans display substantial interindividual clinical variability after SARS-CoV-2 infection1–3, the genetic and immunological basis of which has begun to be deciphered4. However, the extent and drivers of population differences in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear. Here we report single-cell RNA-sequencing data for peripheral blood mononuclear cells—from 222 healthy donors of diverse ancestries—that were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A virus. We show that SARS-CoV-2 induces weaker, but more heterogeneous, interferon-stimulated gene activity compared with influenza A virus, and a unique pro-inflammatory signature in myeloid cells. Transcriptional responses to viruses display marked population differences, primarily driven by changes in cell abundance including increased lymphoid differentiation associated with latent cytomegalovirus infection. Expression quantitative trait loci and mediation analyses reveal a broad effect of cell composition on population disparities in immune responses, with genetic variants exerting a strong effect on specific loci. Furthermore, we show that natural selection has increased population differences in immune responses, particularly for variants associated with SARS-CoV-2 response in East Asians, and document the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which Neanderthal introgression has altered immune functions, such as the response of myeloid cells to viruses. Finally, colocalization and transcriptome-wide association analyses reveal an overlap between the genetic basis of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 severity, providing insights into the factors contributing to current disparities in COVID-19 risk. Population differences in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 can be explained by environmental exposures, but also by local adaptation acting through genetic variants acquired after admixture with archaic hominin forms.",Yann Aquino Aurélie Bisiaux Zhi Li Mary O’Neill Javier Mendoza-Revilla Sarah Hélène Merkling Gaspard Kerner Milena Hasan Valentina Libri Vincent Bondet Nikaïa Smith Camille de Cevins Mickaël Ménager Francesca Luca Roger Pique-Regi Giovanna Barba-Spaeth Stefano Pietropaoli Olivier Schwartz Geert Leroux-Roels Cheuk-Kwong Lee Kathy Leung Joseph T.

A cool runaway greenhouse without surface magma ocean,"Water vapour atmospheres with content equivalent to the Earth’s oceans, resulting from impacts1 or a high insolation2,3, were found to yield a surface magma ocean4,5. This was, however, a consequence of assuming a fully convective structure2–11. Here, we report using a consistent climate model that pure steam atmospheres are commonly shaped by radiative layers, making their thermal structure strongly dependent on the stellar spectrum and internal heat flow. The surface is cooler when an adiabatic profile is not imposed; melting Earth’s crust requires an insolation several times higher than today, which will not happen during the main sequence of the Sun. Venus’s surface can solidify before the steam atmosphere escapes, which is the opposite of previous works4,5. Around the reddest stars (Teff  <  3,000 K), surface magma oceans cannot form by stellar forcing alone, whatever the water content. These findings affect observable signatures of steam atmospheres and exoplanet mass–radius relationships, drastically changing current constraints on the water content of TRAPPIST-1 planets. Unlike adiabatic structures, radiative–convective profiles are sensitive to opacities. New measurements of poorly constrained high-pressure opacities, in particular far from the H2O absorption bands, are thus necessary to refine models of steam atmospheres, which are important stages in terrestrial planet evolution. It is reported using a consistent climate model that pure steam atmospheres are commonly shaped by radiative layers, making their thermal structure strongly dependent on the stellar spectrum and internal heat flow.",Franck Selsis Jérémy Leconte Martin Turbet Guillaume Chaverot Émeline Bolmont,10.1038s41586-023-06258-3,2023-08-09
Tail engagement of arrestin at the glucagon receptor,"Arrestins have pivotal roles in regulating G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling by desensitizing G protein activation and mediating receptor internalization1,2. It has been proposed that the arrestin binds to the receptor in two different conformations, ‘tail’ and ‘core’, which were suggested to govern distinct processes of receptor signalling and trafficking3,4. However, little structural information is available for the tail engagement of the arrestins. Here we report two structures of the glucagon receptor (GCGR) bound to β-arrestin 1 (βarr1) in glucagon-bound and ligand-free states. These structures reveal a receptor tail-engaged binding mode of βarr1 with many unique features, to our knowledge, not previously observed. Helix VIII, instead of the receptor core, has a major role in accommodating βarr1 by forming extensive interactions with the central crest of βarr1. The tail-binding pose is further defined by a close proximity between the βarr1 C-edge and the receptor helical bundle, and stabilized by a phosphoinositide derivative that bridges βarr1 with helices I and VIII of GCGR. Lacking any contact with the arrestin, the receptor core is in an inactive state and loosely binds to glucagon. Further functional studies suggest that the tail conformation of GCGR–βarr governs βarr recruitment at the plasma membrane and endocytosis of GCGR, and provides a molecular basis for the receptor forming a super-complex simultaneously with G protein and βarr to promote sustained signalling within endosomes. These findings extend our knowledge about the arrestin-mediated modulation of GPCR functionalities. Structures of the glucagon receptor bound to β-arrestin 1 are reported, providing further information about the arrestin-mediated modulation of G protein-coupled receptors.",Kun Chen Chenhui Zhang Shuling Lin Xinyu Yan Heng Cai Cuiying Yi Limin Ma Xiaojing Chu Yuchen Liu Ya Zhu Shuo Han Qiang Zhao Beili Wu,10.1038s41586-023-06420-x,2023-08-09
Diverse values of nature for sustainability,"Twenty-five years since foundational publications on valuing ecosystem services for human well-being1,2, addressing the global biodiversity crisis3 still implies confronting barriers to incorporating nature’s diverse values into decision-making. These barriers include powerful interests supported by current norms and legal rules such as property rights, which determine whose values and which values of nature are acted on. A better understanding of how and why nature is (under)valued is more urgent than ever4. Notwithstanding agreements to incorporate nature’s values into actions, including the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF)5 and the UN Sustainable Development Goals6, predominant environmental and development policies still prioritize a subset of values, particularly those linked to markets, and ignore other ways people relate to and benefit from nature7. Arguably, a ‘values crisis’ underpins the intertwined crises of biodiversity loss and climate change8, pandemic emergence9 and socio-environmental injustices10. On the basis of more than 50,000 scientific publications, policy documents and Indigenous and local knowledge sources, the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) assessed knowledge on nature’s diverse values and valuation methods to gain insights into their role in policymaking and fuller integration into decisions7,11. Applying this evidence, combinations of values-centred approaches are proposed to improve valuation and address barriers to uptake, ultimately leveraging transformative changes towards more just (that is, fair treatment of people and nature, including inter- and intragenerational equity) and sustainable futures. Following a wide-ranging review of studies, reports and policies about nature’s multiple values, combinations of values-centred approaches are proposed to improve valuation of nature, address barriers to uptake in decision-making, and make transformative changes towards more just and sustainable futures.",Unai Pascual Patricia Balvanera Christopher B.

Bonding wood with uncondensed lignins as adhesives,"Plywood is widely used in construction such as for flooring and interior walls, as well as in the manufacture of household items such as furniture and cabinets. Such items are made of wood veneers that are bonded together with adhesives such as urea-formaldehyde (UF) and phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resins1,2. Researchers in academia and industry have long aimed to synthesize lignin-phenol-formaldehyde (LPF) resin adhesives using biomass-derived lignin, a phenolic polymer that can be used to substitute the petroleum-derived phenol3-6. However, LPF resin adhesives are less attractive to plywood manufacturers than UF and PF resins due to their appearance and cost. Here we report a simple and practical strategy for preparing lignin-based wood adhesives from lignocellulosic biomass. Our strategy involves separation of uncondensed or slightly condensed lignins from biomass followed by directly applying a suspension of the lignin and water as an adhesive on wood veneers. Plywood products with superior performances could be prepared with such lignin adhesives at a wide range of hot-pressing temperatures, enabling the adhesives highly promising alternatives to traditional wood adhesives in different market segments. Mechanistic studies indicate that the adhesion mechanism of such lignin adhesives may involve softening of lignin by water, filling of vessels with softened lignin, and crosslinking of lignins in adhesives with those in cell wall.",Guangxu Yang Zhenggang Gong Xiaolin Luo Lihui Chen Li Shuai,10.1038s41586-023-06507-5,2023-08-08

Synthesis and properties of cyclic sandwich compounds,"Cyclic nanometre-scale sandwich complexes assembled from individual building blocks were synthesized. Sandwich complexes, in which a metal ion is π-coordinated by two planar aromatic organic rings belong to the foundations of organometallic chemistry. They have been successfully used in a wide variety of applications ranging from catalysis, synthesis and electrochemistry to nanotechnology, materials science and medicine1,2. Extending the sandwich structural motif leads to linear multidecker compounds, in which aromatic organic rings and metal atoms are arranged in an alternating fashion. However, the extension to a cyclic multidecker scaffold is unprecedented. Here we show the design, synthesis and characterization of an isomorphous series of circular sandwich compounds, for which the term ‘cyclocenes’ is suggested. These cyclocenes consist of 18 repeating units, forming almost ideally circular, closed rings in the solid state, that can be described by the general formula [cyclo-MII(μ-η8:η8-CotTIPS)]18 (M = Sr, Sm, Eu; CotTIPS = 1,4-(iPr3Si)2C8H62−). Quantum chemical calculations lead to the conclusion that a unique interplay between the ionic metal-to-ligand bonds, the bulkiness of the ligand system and the energy gain on ring closure, which is crucially influenced by dispersion interactions, facilitate the formation of these cyclic systems. Up to now, only linear one-dimensional multidecker sandwich compounds have been investigated for possible applications such as nanowires3–10. This textbook example of cyclic sandwich compounds is expected to open the door for further innovations towards new functional organometallic materials. The design, synthesis and characterization of a series of circular sandwich compounds, cyclocenes, is described, and these cyclic sandwich compounds are expected to lead to further innovations in new functional organometallic materials.",Luca Münzfeld Sebastian Gillhuber Adrian Hauser Sergei Lebedkin Pauline Hädinger Nicolai D.

3D integration enables ultralow-noise isolator-free lasers in silicon photonics,"Photonic integrated circuits are widely used in applications such as telecommunications and data-centre interconnects1–5. However, in optical systems such as microwave synthesizers6, optical gyroscopes7 and atomic clocks8, photonic integrated circuits are still considered inferior solutions despite their advantages in size, weight, power consumption and cost. Such high-precision and highly coherent applications favour ultralow-noise laser sources to be integrated with other photonic components in a compact and robustly aligned format—that is, on a single chip—for photonic integrated circuits to replace bulk optics and fibres. There are two major issues preventing the realization of such envisioned photonic integrated circuits: the high phase noise of semiconductor lasers and the difficulty of integrating optical isolators directly on-chip. Here we challenge this convention by leveraging three-dimensional integration that results in ultralow-noise lasers with isolator-free operation for silicon photonics. Through multiple monolithic and heterogeneous processing sequences, direct on-chip integration of III–V gain medium and ultralow-loss silicon nitride waveguides with optical loss around 0.5 decibels per metre are demonstrated. Consequently, the demonstrated photonic integrated circuit enters a regime that gives rise to ultralow-noise lasers and microwave synthesizers without the need for optical isolators, owing to the ultrahigh-quality-factor cavity. Such photonic integrated circuits also offer superior scalability for complex functionalities and volume production, as well as improved stability and reliability over time. The three-dimensional integration on ultralow-loss photonic integrated circuits thus marks a critical step towards complex systems and networks on silicon. Three-dimensional integration of distributed-feedback lasers and ultralow-loss silicon nitride waveguides results in ultralow-noise lasers without the need for optical isolators.",Chao Xiang Warren Jin Osama Terra Bozhang Dong Heming Wang Lue Wu Joel Guo Theodore J.

Fennoscandian tree-ring anatomy shows a warmer modern than medieval climate,"Earth system models and various climate proxy sources indicate global warming is unprecedented during at least the Common Era1. However, tree-ring proxies often estimate temperatures during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (950–1250 ce) that are similar to, or exceed, those recorded for the past century2,3, in contrast to simulation experiments at regional scales4. This not only calls into question the reliability of models and proxies but also contributes to uncertainty in future climate projections5. Here we show that the current climate of the Fennoscandian Peninsula is substantially warmer than that of the medieval period. This highlights the dominant role of anthropogenic forcing in climate warming even at the regional scale, thereby reconciling inconsistencies between reconstructions and model simulations. We used an annually resolved 1,170-year-long tree-ring record that relies exclusively on tracheid anatomical measurements from Pinus sylvestris trees, providing high-fidelity measurements of instrumental temperature variability during the warm season. We therefore call for the construction of more such millennia-long records to further improve our understanding and reduce uncertainties around historical and future climate change at inter-regional and eventually global scales. Annually resolved Fennoscandian tree-ring anatomy records show that the climate of the current industrial era is substantially warmer than that of the medieval period.",Jesper Björklund Kristina Seftigen Markus Stoffel Marina V.

A heavyweight early whale pushes the boundaries of vertebrate morphology,"The fossil record of cetaceans documents how terrestrial animals acquired extreme adaptations and transitioned to a fully aquatic lifestyle1,2. In whales, this is associated with a substantial increase in maximum body size. Although an elongate body was acquired early in cetacean evolution3, the maximum body mass of baleen whales reflects a recent diversification that culminated in the blue whale4. More generally, hitherto known gigantism among aquatic tetrapods evolved within pelagic, active swimmers. Here we describe Perucetus colossus—a basilosaurid whale from the middle Eocene epoch of Peru. It displays, to our knowledge, the highest degree of bone mass increase known to date, an adaptation associated with shallow diving5. The estimated skeletal mass of P. colossus exceeds that of any known mammal or aquatic vertebrate. We show that the bone structure specializations of aquatic mammals are reflected in the scaling of skeletal fraction (skeletal mass versus whole-body mass) across the entire disparity of amniotes. We use the skeletal fraction to estimate the body mass of P. colossus, which proves to be a contender for the title of heaviest animal on record. Cetacean peak body mass had already been reached around 30 million years before previously assumed, in a coastal context in which primary productivity was particularly high. Perucetus colossus, a basilosaurid whale from the middle Eocene epoch of Peru with an extremely pachyosteosclerotic postcranium, is estimated to have a greater skeletal mass than any known mammal or aquatic vertebrate.",Giovanni Bianucci Olivier Lambert Mario Urbina Marco Merella Alberto Collareta Rebecca Bennion Rodolfo Salas-Gismondi Aldo Benites-Palomino Klaas Post Christian de Muizon Giulia Bosio Claudio Di Celma Elisa Malinverno Pietro Paolo Pierantoni Igor Maria Villa Eli Amson,10.1038s41586-023-06381-1,2023-08-02
GPCR activation and GRK2 assembly by a biased intracellular agonist,"Phosphorylation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by GPCR kinases (GRKs) desensitizes G-protein signalling and promotes arrestin signalling, which is also modulated by biased ligands1–6. The molecular assembly of GRKs on GPCRs and the basis of GRK-mediated biased signalling remain largely unknown owing to the weak GPCR–GRK interactions. Here we report the complex structure of neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) bound to GRK2, Gαq and the arrestin-biased ligand SBI-5537. The density map reveals the arrangement of the intact GRK2 with the receptor, with the N-terminal helix of GRK2 docking into the open cytoplasmic pocket formed by the outward movement of the receptor transmembrane helix 6, analogous to the binding of the G protein to the receptor. SBI-553 binds at the interface between GRK2 and NTSR1 to enhance GRK2 binding. The binding mode of SBI-553 is compatible with arrestin binding but clashes with the binding of Gαq protein, thus providing a mechanism for its arrestin-biased signalling capability. In sum, our structure provides a rational model for understanding the details of GPCR–GRK interactions and GRK2-mediated biased signalling. Structural studies on the complex containing G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1), Gαq and the arrestin-biased ligand SBI-553 provide insights into these interactions and a foundation for the design of arrestin-biased ligands for G-protein-coupled receptors.",Jia Duan Heng Liu Fenghui Zhao Qingning Yuan Yujie Ji Xiaoqing Cai Xinheng He Xinzhu Li Junrui Li Kai Wu Tianyu Gao Shengnan Zhu Shi Lin Ming-Wei Wang Xi Cheng Wanchao Yin Yi Jiang Dehua Yang H.

Ultrafast deposition of faceted lithium polyhedra by outpacing SEI formation,"Electrodeposition of lithium (Li) metal is critical for high-energy batteries1. However, the simultaneous formation of a surface corrosion film termed the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)2 complicates the deposition process, which underpins our poor understanding of Li metal electrodeposition. Here we decouple these two intertwined processes by outpacing SEI formation at ultrafast deposition current densities3 while also avoiding mass transport limitations. By using cryogenic electron microscopy4–7, we discover the intrinsic deposition morphology of metallic Li to be that of a rhombic dodecahedron, which is surprisingly independent of electrolyte chemistry or current collector substrate. In a coin cell architecture, these rhombic dodecahedra exhibit near point-contact connectivity with the current collector, which can accelerate inactive Li formation8. We propose a pulse-current protocol that overcomes this failure mode by leveraging Li rhombic dodecahedra as nucleation seeds, enabling the subsequent growth of dense Li that improves battery performance compared with a baseline. While Li deposition and SEI formation have always been tightly linked in past studies, our experimental approach enables new opportunities to fundamentally understand these processes decoupled from each other and bring about new insights to engineer better batteries. We report the discovery of lithium metal’s intrinsic growth morphology, a rhombic dodecahedron, and leverage these rhombic dodecahedra as nucleation seeds for improved battery performance.",Xintong Yuan Bo Liu Matthew Mecklenburg Yuzhang Li,10.1038s41586-023-06235-w,2023-08-02
Netrin-1 blockade inhibits tumour growth and EMT features in endometrial cancer,"Netrin-1 is upregulated in cancers as a protumoural mechanism1. Here we describe netrin-1 upregulation in a majority of human endometrial carcinomas (ECs) and demonstrate that netrin-1 blockade, using an anti-netrin-1 antibody (NP137), is effective in reduction of tumour progression in an EC mouse model. We next examined the efficacy of NP137, as a first-in-class single agent, in a Phase I trial comprising 14 patients with advanced EC. As best response we observed 8 stable disease (8 out of 14, 57.1%) and 1 objective response as RECIST v.1.1 (partial response, 1 out of 14 (7.1%), 51.16% reduction in target lesions at 6 weeks and up to 54.65% reduction during the following 6 months). To evaluate the NP137 mechanism of action, mouse tumour gene profiling was performed, and we observed, in addition to cell death induction, that NP137 inhibited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). By performing bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA-seq on paired pre- and on-treatment biopsies from patients with EC from the NP137 trial, we noted a net reduction in tumour EMT. This was associated with changes in immune infiltrate and increased interactions between cancer cells and the tumour microenvironment. Given the importance of EMT in resistance to current standards of care2, we show in the EC mouse model that a combination of NP137 with carboplatin-paclitaxel outperformed carboplatin-paclitaxel alone. Our results identify netrin-1 blockade as a clinical strategy triggering both tumour debulking and EMT inhibition, thus potentially alleviating resistance to standard treatments. We describe netrin-1 upregulation in a majority of human endometrial carcinomas and demonstrate that netrin-1 blockade, using the anti-netrin-1 antibody NP137, is effective both in a mouse model and in patients with endometrial carcinomas.",Philippe A.

TDP-43 forms amyloid filaments with a distinct fold in type A FTLD-TDP,"The abnormal assembly of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in neuronal and glial cells characterizes nearly all cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and around half of cases of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)1,2. A causal role for TDP-43 assembly in neurodegeneration is evidenced by dominantly inherited missense mutations in TARDBP, the gene encoding TDP-43, that promote assembly and give rise to ALS and FTLD3–7. At least four types (A–D) of FTLD with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP) are defined by distinct brain distributions of assembled TDP-43 and are associated with different clinical presentations of frontotemporal dementia8. We previously showed, using cryo-electron microscopy, that TDP-43 assembles into amyloid filaments in ALS and type B FTLD-TDP9. However, the structures of assembled TDP-43 in FTLD without ALS remained unknown. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of assembled TDP-43 from the brains of three individuals with the most common type of FTLD-TDP, type A. TDP-43 formed amyloid filaments with a new fold that was the same across individuals, indicating that this fold may characterize type A FTLD-TDP. The fold resembles a chevron badge and is unlike the double-spiral-shaped fold of ALS and type B FTLD-TDP, establishing that distinct filament folds of TDP-43 characterize different neurodegenerative conditions. The structures, in combination with mass spectrometry, led to the identification of two new post-translational modifications of assembled TDP-43, citrullination and monomethylation of R293, and indicate that they may facilitate filament formation and observed structural variation in individual filaments. The structures of TDP-43 filaments from type A FTLD-TDP will guide mechanistic studies of TDP-43 assembly, as well as the development of diagnostic and therapeutic compounds for TDP-43 proteinopathies. Cryo-electron microscopy structures and mass spectrometry analyses show that TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) forms amyloid filaments with a distinct fold in type A frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP) compared with TDP-43 filaments in type B FTLD-TDP and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",Diana Arseni Renren Chen Alexey G.

Pharmacological targeting of netrin-1 inhibits EMT in cancer,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulates tumour initiation, progression, metastasis and resistance to anti-cancer therapy1–7. Although great progress has been made in understanding the role of EMT and its regulatory mechanisms in cancer, no therapeutic strategy to pharmacologically target EMT has been identified. Here we found that netrin-1 is upregulated in a primary mouse model of skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) exhibiting spontaneous EMT. Pharmacological inhibition of netrin-1 by administration of NP137, a netrin-1-blocking monoclonal antibody currently used in clinical trials in human cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier 
                NCT02977195
                
              ), decreased the proportion of EMT tumour cells in skin SCC, decreased the number of metastases and increased the sensitivity of tumour cells to chemotherapy. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed the presence of different EMT states, including epithelial, early and late hybrid EMT, and full EMT states, in control SCC. By contrast, administration of NP137 prevented the progression of cancer cells towards a late EMT state and sustained tumour epithelial states. Short hairpin RNA knockdown of netrin-1 and its receptor UNC5B in EPCAM+ tumour cells inhibited EMT in vitro in the absence of stromal cells and regulated a common gene signature that promotes tumour epithelial state and restricts EMT. To assess the relevance of these findings to human cancers, we treated mice transplanted with the A549 human cancer cell line—which undergoes EMT following TGFβ1 administration8,9—with NP137. Netrin-1 inhibition decreased EMT in these transplanted A549 cells. Together, our results identify a pharmacological strategy for targeting EMT in cancer, opening up novel therapeutic interventions for anti-cancer therapy. Netrin-1 is upregulated in cancer models that undergo spontaneous epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and its targeting blocks the progression of tumour cells to a late mesenchymal state, suggesting possible therapeutic applications.",Justine Lengrand Ievgenia Pastushenko Sebastiaan Vanuytven Yura Song David Venet Rahul M.

Frustration- and doping-induced magnetism in a Fermi–Hubbard simulator,"Geometrical frustration in strongly correlated systems can give rise to a plethora of novel ordered states and intriguing magnetic phases, such as quantum spin liquids1–3. Promising candidate materials for such phases4–6 can be described by the Hubbard model on an anisotropic triangular lattice, a paradigmatic model capturing the interplay between strong correlations and magnetic frustration7–11. However, the fate of frustrated magnetism in the presence of itinerant dopants remains unclear, as well as its connection to the doped phases of the square Hubbard model12. Here we investigate the local spin order of a Hubbard model with controllable frustration and doping, using ultracold fermions in anisotropic optical lattices continuously tunable from a square to a triangular geometry. At half-filling and strong interactions U/t ≈ 9, we observe at the single-site level how frustration reduces the range of magnetic correlations and drives a transition from a collinear Néel antiferromagnet to a short-range correlated 120° spiral phase. Away from half-filling, the triangular limit shows enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations on the hole-doped side and a reversal to ferromagnetic correlations at particle dopings above 20%, hinting at the role of kinetic magnetism in frustrated systems. This work paves the way towards exploring possible chiral ordered or superconducting phases in triangular lattices8,13 and realizing t–t′ square lattice Hubbard models that may be essential to describe superconductivity in cuprate materials14. The magnetic phases of the geometrically frustrated triangular lattice Hubbard model are directly investigated using ultracold fermionic atoms, indicating a possible transition to ferromagnetism at a filling of 1.2.",Muqing Xu Lev Haldar Kendrick Anant Kale Youqi Gang Geoffrey Ji Richard T.

Einkorn genomics sheds light on history of the oldest domesticated wheat,"Einkorn (Triticum monococcum) was the first domesticated wheat species, and was central to the birth of agriculture and the Neolithic Revolution in the Fertile Crescent around 10,000 years ago1,2. Here we generate and analyse 5.2-Gb genome assemblies for wild and domesticated einkorn, including completely assembled centromeres. Einkorn centromeres are highly dynamic, showing evidence of ancient and recent centromere shifts caused by structural rearrangements. Whole-genome sequencing analysis of a diversity panel uncovered the population structure and evolutionary history of einkorn, revealing complex patterns of hybridizations and introgressions after the dispersal of domesticated einkorn from the Fertile Crescent. We also show that around 1% of the modern bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) A subgenome originates from einkorn. These resources and findings highlight the history of einkorn evolution and provide a basis to accelerate the genomics-assisted improvement of einkorn and bread wheat. Around 1% of the A subgenome of modern bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) originates from einkorn (Triticum monococcum), the first domesticated wheat species.",Hanin Ibrahim Ahmed Matthias Heuberger Adam Schoen Dal-Hoe Koo Jesus Quiroz-Chavez Laxman Adhikari John Raupp Stéphane Cauet Nathalie Rodde Charlotte Cravero Caroline Callot Gerard R.

Long-term organic carbon preservation enhanced by iron and manganese,"The balance between degradation and preservation of sedimentary organic carbon (OC) is important for global carbon and oxygen cycles1. The relative importance of different mechanisms and environmental conditions contributing to marine sedimentary OC preservation, however, remains unclear2–8. Simple organic molecules can be geopolymerized into recalcitrant forms by means of the Maillard reaction5, although reaction kinetics at marine sedimentary temperatures are thought to be slow9,10. More recent work in terrestrial systems suggests that the reaction can be catalysed by manganese minerals11–13, but the potential for the promotion of geopolymerized OC formation at marine sedimentary temperatures is uncertain. Here we present incubation experiments and find that iron and manganese ions and minerals abiotically catalyse the Maillard reaction by up to two orders of magnitude at temperatures relevant to continental margins where most preservation occurs4. Furthermore, the chemical signature of the reaction products closely resembles dissolved and total OC found in continental margin sediments globally. With the aid of a pore-water model14, we estimate that iron- and manganese-catalysed transformation of simple organic molecules into complex macromolecules might generate on the order of approximately 4.1 Tg C yr−1 for preservation in marine sediments. In the context of perhaps only about 63 Tg C yr−1 variation in sedimentary organic preservation over the past 300 million years6, we propose that variable iron and manganese inputs to the ocean could exert a substantial but hitherto unexplored impact on global OC preservation over geological time. Catalysis of simple organic carbon molecules into complex macromolecules by Fe and Mn may play a fundamental role in organic carbon preservation, to a degree that could substantially affect the Earth’s carbon and oxygen cycles.",Oliver W.

Consent document translation expense hinders inclusive clinical trial enrolment,"Patients from historically under-represented racial and ethnic groups are enrolled in cancer clinical trials at disproportionately low rates in the USA1–3. As these patients often have limited English proficiency4–7, we hypothesized that one barrier to their inclusion is the cost to investigators of translating consent documents. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated more than 12,000 consent events at a large cancer centre and assessed whether patients requiring translated consent documents would sign consent documents less frequently in studies lacking industry sponsorship (for which the principal investigator pays the translation costs) than for industry-sponsored studies (for which the translation costs are covered by the sponsor). Here we show that the proportion of consent events for patients with limited English proficiency in studies not sponsored by industry was approximately half of that seen in industry-sponsored studies. We also show that among those signing consent documents, the proportion of consent documents translated into the patient’s primary language in studies without industry sponsorship was approximately half of that seen in industry-sponsored studies. The results suggest that the cost of consent document translation in trials not sponsored by industry could be a potentially modifiable barrier to the inclusion of patients with limited English proficiency. The availability of translated consent documents improves recruitment of patients with limited English proficiency to clinical trials, indicating a potentially modifiable barrier to the inclusion of patients with limited English proficiency.",Maria A.

Africa-specific human genetic variation near CHD1L associates with HIV-1 load,"HIV-1 remains a global health crisis1, highlighting the need to identify new targets for therapies. Here, given the disproportionate HIV-1 burden and marked human genome diversity in Africa2, we assessed the genetic determinants of control of set-point viral load in 3,879 people of African ancestries living with HIV-1 participating in the international collaboration for the genomics of HIV3. We identify a previously undescribed association signal on chromosome 1 where the peak variant associates with an approximately 0.3 log10-transformed copies per ml lower set-point viral load per minor allele copy and is specific to populations of African descent. The top associated variant is intergenic and lies between a long intergenic non-coding RNA (LINC00624) and the coding gene CHD1L, which encodes a helicase that is involved in DNA repair4. Infection assays in iPS cell-derived macrophages and other immortalized cell lines showed increased HIV-1 replication in CHD1L-knockdown and CHD1L-knockout cells. We provide evidence from population genetic studies that Africa-specific genetic variation near CHD1L associates with HIV replication in vivo. Although experimental studies suggest that CHD1L is able to limit HIV infection in some cell types in vitro, further investigation is required to understand the mechanisms underlying our observations, including any potential indirect effects of CHD1L on HIV spread in vivo that our cell-based assays cannot recapitulate. Africa-specific genetic variation on chromosome 1 near CHD1L is associated with HIV replication in vivo.",Paul J.

Quantum oscillations of the quasiparticle lifetime in a metal,"Following nearly a century of research, it remains a puzzle that the low-lying excitations of metals are remarkably well explained by effective single-particle theories of non-interacting bands1–4. The abundance of interactions in real materials raises the question of direct spectroscopic signatures of phenomena beyond effective single-particle, single-band behaviour. Here we report the identification of quantum oscillations (QOs) in the three-dimensional topological semimetal CoSi, which defy the standard description in two fundamental aspects. First, the oscillation frequency corresponds to the difference of semiclassical quasiparticle (QP) orbits of two bands, which are forbidden as half of the trajectory would oppose the Lorentz force. Second, the oscillations exist up to above 50 K, in strong contrast to all other oscillatory components, which vanish below a few kelvin. Our findings are in excellent agreement with generic model calculations of QOs of the QP lifetime (QPL). Because the only precondition for their existence is a nonlinear coupling of at least two electronic orbits, for example, owing to QP scattering on defects or collective excitations, such QOs of the QPL are generic for any metal featuring Landau quantization with several orbits. They are consistent with certain frequencies in topological semimetals5–9, unconventional superconductors10,11, rare-earth compounds12–14 and Rashba systems15, and permit to identify and gauge correlation phenomena, for example, in two-dimensional materials16,17 and multiband metals18. Quantum oscillations in the three-dimensional topological semimetal CoSi are reported, where selected oscillation frequencies have no corresponding extremal Fermi surface cross-sections, representing instead oscillations of the quasiparticle lifetime.",Nico Huber Valentin Leeb Andreas Bauer Georg Benka Johannes Knolle Christian Pfleiderer Marc A.

cGAS–STING drives ageing-related inflammation and neurodegeneration,"Low-grade inflammation is a hallmark of old age and a central driver of ageing-associated impairment and disease1. Multiple factors can contribute to ageing-associated inflammation2; however, the molecular pathways that transduce aberrant inflammatory signalling and their impact in natural ageing remain unclear. Here we show that the cGAS–STING signalling pathway, which mediates immune sensing of DNA3, is a critical driver of chronic inflammation and functional decline during ageing. Blockade of STING suppresses the inflammatory phenotypes of senescent human cells and tissues, attenuates ageing-related inflammation in multiple peripheral organs and the brain in mice, and leads to an improvement in tissue function. Focusing on the ageing brain, we reveal that activation of STING triggers reactive microglial transcriptional states, neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Cytosolic DNA released from perturbed mitochondria elicits cGAS activity in old microglia, defining a mechanism by which cGAS–STING signalling is engaged in the ageing brain. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing analysis of microglia and hippocampi of a cGAS gain-of-function mouse model demonstrates that engagement of cGAS in microglia is sufficient to direct ageing-associated transcriptional microglial states leading to bystander cell inflammation, neurotoxicity and impaired memory capacity. Our findings establish the cGAS–STING pathway as a driver of ageing-related inflammation in peripheral organs and the brain, and reveal blockade of cGAS–STING signalling as a potential strategy to halt neurodegenerative processes during old age. The cGAS–STING signalling pathway is a critical driver of chronic inflammation and functional decline during ageing, and could be targeted to halt neurodegenerative processes during old age.",Muhammet F.

The break of earthquake asperities imaged by distributed acoustic sensing,"Rupture imaging of megathrust earthquakes with global seismic arrays revealed frequency-dependent rupture signatures1–4, but the role of high-frequency radiators remains unclear3–5. Similar observations of the more abundant crustal earthquakes could provide critical constraints but are rare without ultradense local arrays6,7. Here we use distributed acoustic sensing technology8,9 to image the high-frequency earthquake rupture radiators. By converting a 100-kilometre dark-fibre cable into a 10,000-channel seismic array, we image four high-frequency subevents for the 2021 Antelope Valley, California, moment-magnitude 6.0 earthquake. After comparing our results with long-period moment-release10,11 and dynamic rupture simulations, we suggest that the imaged subevents are due to the breaking of fault asperities—stronger spots or pins on the fault—that substantially modulate the overall rupture behaviour. An otherwise fading rupture propagation could be promoted by the breaking of fault asperities in a cascading sequence. This study highlights how we can use the extensive pre-existing fibre networks12 as high-frequency seismic antennas to systematically investigate the rupture process of regional moderate-sized earthquakes. Coupled with dynamic rupture modelling, it could improve our understanding of earthquake rupture dynamics. Distributed acoustic sensing technology is utilized to image four high-frequency rupture subevents of the 2021 Antelope Valley, California, earthquake; the results indicate that the subevents are due to the breaking of fault asperities.",Jiaxuan Li Taeho Kim Nadia Lapusta Ettore Biondi Zhongwen Zhan,10.1038s41586-023-06227-w,2023-08-02
Authigenic mineral phases as a driver of the upper-ocean iron cycle,"Iron is important in regulating the ocean carbon cycle1. Although several dissolved and particulate species participate in oceanic iron cycling, current understanding emphasizes the importance of complexation by organic ligands in stabilizing oceanic dissolved iron concentrations2–6. However, it is difficult to reconcile this view of ligands as a primary control on dissolved iron cycling with the observed size partitioning of dissolved iron species, inefficient dissolved iron regeneration at depth or the potential importance of authigenic iron phases in particulate iron observational datasets7–12. Here we present a new dissolved iron, ligand and particulate iron seasonal dataset from the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) region. We find that upper-ocean dissolved iron dynamics were decoupled from those of ligands, which necessitates a process by which dissolved iron escapes ligand stabilization to generate a reservoir of authigenic iron particles that settle to depth. When this ‘colloidal shunt’ mechanism was implemented in a global-scale biogeochemical model, it reproduced both seasonal iron-cycle dynamics observations and independent global datasets when previous models failed13–15. Overall, we argue that the turnover of authigenic particulate iron phases must be considered alongside biological activity and ligands in controlling ocean-dissolved iron distributions and the coupling between dissolved and particulate iron pools. Analysis of a new dissolved iron, ligand and particulate iron seasonal dataset shows that authigenic iron phases help control ocean dissolved iron distributions and the coupling between dissolved and particulate iron pools.",Alessandro Tagliabue Kristen N.

Synergy and oxygen adaptation for development of next-generation probiotics,"The human gut microbiota has gained interest as an environmental factor that may contribute to health or disease1. The development of next-generation probiotics is a promising strategy to modulate the gut microbiota and improve human health; however, several key candidate next-generation probiotics are strictly anaerobic2 and may require synergy with other bacteria for optimal growth. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is a highly prevalent and abundant human gut bacterium associated with human health, but it has not yet been developed into probiotic formulations2. Here we describe the co-isolation of F. prausnitzii and Desulfovibrio piger, a sulfate-reducing bacterium, and their cross-feeding for growth and butyrate production. To produce a next-generation probiotic formulation, we adapted F. prausnitzii to tolerate oxygen exposure, and, in proof-of-concept studies, we demonstrate that the symbiotic product is tolerated by mice and humans (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: 
                NCT03728868
                
              ) and is detected in the human gut in a subset of study participants. Our study describes a technology for the production of next-generation probiotics based on the adaptation of strictly anaerobic bacteria to tolerate oxygen exposures without a reduction in potential beneficial properties. Our technology may be used for the development of other strictly anaerobic strains as next-generation probiotics. The anaerobic gut bacterium Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was isolated and adapted for oxygen tolerance to develop a next-generation probiotic for the treatment of conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and type 2 diabetes.",Muhammad Tanweer Khan Chinmay Dwibedi Daniel Sundh Meenakshi Pradhan Jamie D.

Spin-mediated shear oscillators in a van der Waals antiferromagnet,"Understanding how microscopic spin configuration gives rise to exotic properties at the macroscopic length scale has long been pursued in magnetic materials1–5. One seminal example is the Einstein–de Haas effect in ferromagnets1,6,7, in which angular momentum of spins can be converted into mechanical rotation of an entire object. However, for antiferromagnets without net magnetic moment, how spin ordering couples to macroscopic movement remains elusive. Here we observed a seesaw-like rotation of reciprocal lattice peaks of an antiferromagnetic nanolayer film, whose gigahertz structural resonance exhibits more than an order-of-magnitude amplification after cooling below the Néel temperature. Using a suite of ultrafast diffraction and microscopy techniques, we directly visualize this spin-driven rotation in reciprocal space at the nanoscale. This motion corresponds to interlayer shear in real space, in which individual micro-patches of the film behave as coherent oscillators that are phase-locked and shear along the same in-plane axis. Using time-resolved optical polarimetry, we further show that the enhanced mechanical response strongly correlates with ultrafast demagnetization, which releases elastic energy stored in local strain gradients to drive the oscillators. Our work not only offers the first microscopic view of spin-mediated mechanical motion of an antiferromagnet but it also identifies a new route towards realizing high-frequency resonators8,9 up to the millimetre band, so the capability of controlling magnetic states on the ultrafast timescale10–13 can be readily transferred to engineering the mechanical properties of nanodevices. Using several ultrafast diffraction and microscopy techniques, demagnetization-driven interlayer shear of a van der Waals antiferromagnet is visualized at the nanoscale.",Alfred Zong Qi Zhang Faran Zhou Yifan Su Kyle Hwangbo Xiaozhe Shen Qianni Jiang Haihua Liu Thomas E.

Central role of Tim17 in mitochondrial presequence protein translocation,"The presequence translocase of the mitochondrial inner membrane (TIM23) represents the major route for the import of nuclear-encoded proteins into mitochondria1,2. About 60% of more than 1,000 different mitochondrial proteins are synthesised with amino-terminal targeting signals, termed presequences, which form positively charged amphiphilic α-helices3,4. TIM23 sorts the presequence proteins into the inner membrane or matrix. Various views including regulatory and coupling functions have been reported on the essential TIM23 subunit Tim175–7. We mapped the interaction of Tim17 with matrix-targeted and inner membrane-sorted preproteins during translocation in the native membrane environment. We show that Tim17 contains conserved negative charges close to the intermembrane space side of the bilayer, which are essential to initiate presequence protein translocation along a distinct transmembrane cavity of Tim17 for both classes of preproteins. The amphiphilic character of mitochondrial presequences directly matches this Tim17-dependent translocation mechanism. This mechanism permits direct lateral release of transmembrane segments of inner membrane-sorted precursors into the inner membrane.",Laura F. Fielden Jakob D. Busch Sandra G.
